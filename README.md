fida is a proof-of-concept program that shows how to do _element-wise XML revision tracking_ and _version control_.

The system's key features are

 * Centralized architecture,
 * Repository itself is an XML file,
 * Command-line interface similar to SVN or CVS,
 * XML element instances can be revision tracked individually,
 * Tracked XML elements can be referenced,
 * References can be migrated.

Start with the [quick installation guide](http://code.google.com/p/xml-snippets/wiki/QuickInstallGuide), and then continue to the [introduction tutorial](http://code.google.com/p/xml-snippets/wiki/IntroductionTutorial). 

List of all online tutorials is available in the [Wiki's Table of Contents](http://code.google.com/p/xml-snippets/wiki/WikiTableOfContents). Good for an overall view. 

This program and these pages do not concentrate on issues such as producing XML deltas or 3-way merges of the tree-structures. The main objective here is to demonstrate how to track revisions of XML elements.
